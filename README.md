# COVID-19-Global-Trend
This uses the dataset from the JHU COVID-19 Github repository https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 and plot the confirmed and death cases in the top regions across the world. 
It serves as a personal reference to this global crisis and a way to learn more Python techniques, so some of the features are not perfect nor complete.
