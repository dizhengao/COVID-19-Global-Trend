# COVID-19-Global-Trend
This uses dataset from the [JHU COVID-19 Github repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and plots confirmed and death cases in top regions across the world. 

It was made in late Mar 2020 just as a personal reference to track covid and learn more Python while staying at home. Many features are not complete... 

It uses Heroku to deploy and publish the app.py, and the plot can be found [here](https://covid-19-zd.herokuapp.com).
