# COVID-19-Global-Trend
This uses the dataset from the JHU COVID-19 Github repository https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 and plot the confirmed and death cases in the top regions across the world. 

I made this in late Mar and used it not only as a personal reference to this global crisis but also a way to learn more Python techniques while staying at home. Not too much effort has been put in this so some of the features are not perfect nor complete. 

It replies on Heroku to deploy and publish the app.py and the plot can be found here: https://covid-19-zd.herokuapp.com.
